## Part 2: The Battlefield

### Phase 1: Creating your Warrior

- Build the base class for every creature: fighters.Being
- Build two sub-types: fighters.Human, fighters.Monster
- Build two battle types for Humans: fighters.Knight, fighters.Mage
- Build two battle types for Monsters: fighters.Troll, fighters.Elf
- Build two interfaces for any being class: fighters.Fighter, fighters.MagicUser

### Phase 2: Test your Warrior Classes

- Your objects need to pass all 8 test in the "test()" method provided to you.
- Experiment with different warrior types and stat point distributions to create the best warrior you can.
- Send your object code to the teacher. (this will just be the one line of code to create your object)

### Phase 3: Put your Warriors in Battle and Defeat your Classmates

- Teacher will plugin the code for each student and watch the mayhem in the tournament class

## To Do List

* [ ] finish the battle loop
    * [x] after first battle, program moves to next two players
    * [ ] set up different ending for final fight in playerList 
    * [ ] announce VICTORY ROYAL
* [ ] refine attacks/defenses for MagicUsers (they seem too weak)
* [ ] include an image for the objects, must be a 200x200 png/jpg
* [ ] include a strict mode that also checks for negative stat values
* [ ] include custom descriptive messages for battle start/end (communicate args)

### Phase 4: Create Your Own Monsters and Customize your Actions
